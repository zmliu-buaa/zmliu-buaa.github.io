I am currently an Assistant Professor at [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn), working closely with [Prof. Yunhong Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=0ez7lA0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Prof. Haifeng Wang](https://haifengwang.net/). Before that, I received a B.E. degree from the Harbin Institute of Technology, an M.S. degree from Peking University, and a Ph.D. degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, under the supervision of Prof. Haifeng Wang (the first Chinese president of the ACL, the founding chair of the AACL, ACL Fellow, IEEE Fellow, CAAI Fellow and Academician of International Eurasian Academy of Science). My current research fields include (multimodal) large language model, agent (mainly focus on tool learning, planning, memory, self-evolving, GUI agent, embodied intelligence), natural language processing, and have published 50 papers in refereed journals and conference proceedings, such as Nature Communications (corresponding author), TKDE, SCIS, ACL, CVPR, EMNLP, NAACL, AAAI, and ACM MM.

I have guided 7 undergraduate students to publish papers as the first authors in international top-tier conferences. I guided students to secure 2 "Champion" titles (ranking first nationwide, with a total of 122 such titles awarded across the country) and 1 Special Prize (ranking among the top five nationwide) in the 2025 China Youth Science and Technology Innovation "Solution Proposal and Leadership Challenge" Competition (also known as the National Challenge Cup, hailed as the "Olympic Games" for contemporary college students' scientific and technological innovation). I have led multiple projects related to large language models and possess extensive experience in research and development. The tools developed by me receive nearly a hundred million daily calls on average. My research achievements have been widely applied in companies such as Baidu, Meituan, and Kuaishou, yielding significant benefits.

<p style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">I am recruiting Ph.D. and Master's students. Interested candidates are welcome to contact me directly via email. I will carefully read all emails and respond promptly.</p>
